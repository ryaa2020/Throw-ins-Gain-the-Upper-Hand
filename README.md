## About The Project

Our goal in this project was to analyze the success of throw-ins during soccer matches using throw-in location and other factors such as pass length, pass height, pass angle, and which player throws the ball in. We defined success a couple of different ways: one being whether the team executing the throw-in successfully makes first contact with the ball, and the other is whether the team executing the throw-in retains possession for at least seven seconds following the throw-in. 


## Getting Started

## Usage

This project can be used to analyze soccer throw-ins and provide soccer teams with data on how to more successfully utilize their throw-in opportunities.

## Roadmap

The project is organized into several folders. The firstContact folder contains all of our files relevant to making successful first contact after a throw-in. The fullData folder contains the code we used to access all the necessary data and create files to store that data. The playerThrowIn folder holds all of our work relating to player-specific throw-in data, while the retainPossession folder contains our work on determining whether a team retains possession of the ball after a throw-in. Lastly, the shotOnGoal folder contains unfinished files that investigate shot creation in relation to throw-ins.
